In April 2013, I started working on a small lisp implementation,
but I abandoned it almost immediately.

In June 2021, I started writing a new lisp from scratch.
The most basic stuff is implemented: functions, macros,
quasiquotes, etc.

To run a lisp script: `z-lisp <path-to-the-script>`.

There is a basic repl: `z-lisp src/main/repl.lisp`
